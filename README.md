# hello-world
I will enter a sentance before the SteelMan 1 main part to see what that does

Here there shall be a second paragraph.
and one more line/sentence.
I have Steelman2 added sentence 2. And another, 3.
Add an new branch and merge.

This repository is based on the GitHub tutorial, and will possibly future tests of GitHub or sharing
OoOo Martin 1.

Here is one at the end.
Steelman Deletion1

(empty line)
Another sentence in this last OoOoMartin2 paragraph will be helpful. A third one inline will also be helpful.
Ok, then we will work on this one as well.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Now we will make the last sentence Steelman3 a whole new paragraph. A fourth one on the last line will make it complete.
